# Syntropy Involvement Guidelines

_Version: v.1.0_

_Latest Update: 2020-12-30_

Hello, community!

All kinds of contributions are welcome and necessary to our success as we move forward with the project. We couldn't be happier with your increasing involvement, and now we take this a step further. 

We invite you to contribute to the Syntropy Stack development and growth!

Here are the guidelines. Please let us know if you have any feedback on how we can improve this program. 

To help you get started, we've prepared you a list of tasks, which you will find in a dedicated [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17LkBLbccGLMq5LkBDgxBohNIXTJ-AZlJI8y34AYWBVE/edit?usp=sharing). As we progress, we will be updating the sheet with new tasks and letting you know on #community-involvement channel as we do so. 

We always welcome new ideas, so if you have your own case study or contribution to propose, please do so on #community-involvement channel on Discord.


# Registration

In the task sheet, you will see whether someone had already completed the task or not, indicating tasks that are still open. 

Every time we update the list of tasks, we will make an announcement on #community-involvement channel.

If you want to apply to a specific task, you will need to fill in the [dedicated form](https://forms.gle/r7sznFvqjp5U7TZT8).

You can apply to more than one task at once, but we will try our best to split the workload evenly among those who apply. We will decide who to assign to each task according to our internal guidelines and publish the list of assigned people on #community-involvement channel. 

Complete registration does not mean that you are assigned for the task! 

When your application is approved, we will invite you to join the corresponding working group channel and say hello to the Group Lead(s).


# Working Groups

Each task is always assigned to a working group. Working groups are comprised of individual developers or teams working on specific tasks. Working groups are here to facilitate the collaborative nature of the project. Ask questions if you have stumbled upon an obstacle and lend a hand for those in need. We are a one community.

Each working group is assigned a channel for all related discussions. 

The purpose of these channels is to keep all communication public so that:



1. All information would be readily available to others who might join the working group in a later stage.
2. Group Leads could better manage communications with developers.
3. Other developers working on similar tasks would be able to help you with any obstacles you are having or provide feedback. 

Working group channels are only visible to all, but only those currently involved in a task, those involved in the past, Group Leads and other Syntropy employees can participate in discussions.


## Group Lead

Group lead is your main point of contact if you need additional information, materials, assets, or just want to ask a question. Working groups can have more than one group lead. The one assigned to your task is responsible for validating and approving your work. Compensation is only distributed once the group lead deems the task as completed. We highly encourage you to use dedicated working group channels for all communications with your group lead and refrain from using private messages.


# Tasks

If the scope of work is too large, tasks are divided into subtasks. Subtasks should be treated the same way as tasks. Each task or subtask has a unique ID, which you will need to select in your application. We will use the task ID to refer to the specific task if there is such a need and encourage you to do so too.

Tasks or subtasks can have bonus tasks - more on that in a dedicated chapter.

Always check the full documentation of the task if available. There, you will find a complete description and requirements of the task.

There are different types of tasks, e.g. "Case Study", "Contribution". As we move forward and add new types of tasks, we will update the guidelines.


## Case Study

These tasks are intended to leverage Syntropy Stack's existing functionality to develop new use-cases for the technology, facilitate future deployments and guide other developers. 


## Contribution

These tasks are intended to extend the functionality of Syntropy Stack, add integrations, etc. 


# General Task Requirements

For the task to be considered as completed:



*   Your GitHub repository is finished and functional.
*   Your GitHub repository includes a concise and detailed Readme.
*   Your GitHub repository pull request is approved and merged. 
*   Your Group Lead approved and validated your work.


# Submitting a GitHub Repository

_Will be updated shortly. _


# Writing a Good Readme

Each submitted GitHub repository has to include a concise and detailed Readme of the project. 

You will find quality examples and articles on how to write a good Readme here:

# Bonus Tasks

Some tasks or subtasks have bonus tasks. By completing these tasks, you will receive additional compensation determined in a task sheet. We highly encourage you to complete these bonus tasks together with the main task. If you choose not to do bonus tasks, they remain open for other community members. This means that others can join in and complete bonus tasks once you are done with the main task and receive rewards. The task is not marked as completed until all bonus tasks are completed.

Some bonus tasks are required to be completed by the same person who completes the main task. Always check in the task sheet.

There are different types of bonus tasks. We will describe them all in these guidelines and will update the list as we progress.


## Tutorial / Blog

For this task, you will be writing a tutorial for a blog post. The tutorial has to be written in clear and concise English.

It has to be uploaded to medium.com and dev.to. If you wish, you can also upload it to your blog or other sites of your choice (e.g. Hacker News, Hacker Noon, Reddit, etc.). 

Imagine that you are a developer trying to achieve the same result you've just done by completing the main task. Write a tutorial for him/her. Make sure to include all major steps, code snippets, screenshots and whatever information you deem necessary.

You don't have to detail steps that are highly specific to other tools (e.g. setting up Digital Ocean Droplet). Assume that your reader has some experience in using the tools that you use in your tutorial. However, if it's something more complicated, please include a link to a relevant tutorial. Use common sense and try to strike the right balance. Found something to be more difficult than you expected? You probably read a tutorial on that. Put the link in your own tutorial.

A tutorial is not readme!

Make sure to include a brief introduction of what is the end goal of the tutorial. Also, have a conclusion. Ideally, think about how this can help the average developer. How does this come into play in real-world scenarios, and how do you envision Syntropy Stack being used in these applications?

It's imperative to keep in mind that the broader audience might be unaware of Syntropy Stack. When writing a tutorial, always include a description of what Syntropy Stack is. You can use and expand the description below, but try to explain it in your own words.  

Syntropy Stack is a selection of applications and tools that enables you to set up secure connectivity across all endpoints quickly. You can connect any service and device running on a cloud, on-premise, and edge infrastructure. If you need to connect thousands of endpoints, you can do so using Syntropy software agent in combination with container-orchestration systems like Kubernetes and configuration tools like Ansible. 

If you see fit, try to explain why you use Syntropy Stack to do one thing or another in a tutorial.

Writing a tutorial is a lot easier while you are in the process of doing the main task. That's why we usually make this bonus task required to be completed together with your main task.

Once you are done with the tutorial, it has to be approved by your Group Lead. 

Also, feel free to share it wherever you like!



## Screen Recording

For this task, you will be creating a screen recording. We recommend using Loom, but you can choose any software you like.

Imagine that you are a developer trying to achieve the same result you've just done by completing the main task. Make a screen recording for him/her. Make sure to include all major steps and whatever information you deem necessary.

If you've also written a tutorial, make sure to attach this recording to that publication. If not, make sure to upload it to your chosen platform (e.g. Twitter, Youtube, dev.to). One upload is required, but feel free to upload it to more than one platform.


# Compensation

In the task sheet, you will see the USD worth of compensation for each task. The compensation is based on the difficulty of the task and the time required to complete it. Payments will be made in an equivalent amount of $NOIA tokens to the compensation's USD value. The exact amount of tokens is calculated at the very moment we send you the rewards. When we distribute tokens depends on the gas price, but we do that as soon as possible after the task is marked as completed. You will be eligible for compensation only after the task is completed, and the responsible person validates it. Once it's done, please send the wallet address to which you wish to receive your tokens to @Nojus_Li.


# Teamwork

We have determined how many people are required to complete each task. If you believe that the number is too low or too high, you can shoot us a message, and we will reevaluate. However, keep in mind that the compensation pool is a fixed amount per task. 


# Deadlines

In the task sheet, you will find a due date for each task. Please stay within deadlines. Deadlines can be discussed and reevaluated before you commit to the task. Some tasks might be missing deadlines, but this does not mean that there is no deadline. In such cases, we will agree on a deadline before you commit to the task. If you feel that you won't be able to finish the task until the deadline, let us know beforehand. In that case, you can find someone from the community to help you, or we can find someone. Each case is different, so most importantly, communicate.
